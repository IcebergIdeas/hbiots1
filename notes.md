## Notes



* [!] Improve Bot take. Presently it just goes around trying to take all the time.
* [!] Improve Bot take so that it tends not to take blocks that are adjacent to other blocks.
* [!] Continue Bot implementation using the current not-smart-at-all approach. (Better define what we mean by that.)
* Manage inventory more sensibly or make it much simpler.
* Move toward client/server?
* Handle errors
* Discuss Story Tests and what Hill calls the Pyramid Problem
* This card reads "Test groundtash, why arithmetic? domain not math, Obstruction." What did I have in mind? [Ah! That says "test granularity", per Hill's observations.]
* Use private methods in world. (I remember this one! The idea is to begin to make more clear which methods are there for the client and which are internal.)
* [!] Don't step on things.
* Things on top of things: entities access by x,y
* Clocking
* Vision
* Logging on screen.
* [!] Indications on screen that bot is carrying etc
* [!] Drive screen from world, not its own list
* Drop off screen! (fixed?)
* Robot eats robot. (fixed?)
* Would Extract Method Object be a good move for `do_something`?
* Should all Entities be sent do_something?
* Keep track of inventory on server side? 
* Learn pytest fixtures?
